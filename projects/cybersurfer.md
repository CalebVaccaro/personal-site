detailedDescription: Leading a team of 5 to create the first hoverboard controller for VR where players can race to be the fastest. We were successfully able to create an MVP using a player's body weight to move in an early CyberSurfer demo. From there, I knew I needed to pursue the idea more, pivoting to a mobile-phone and controller, turning our product into an ecosystem.
